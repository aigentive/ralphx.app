## Session Log

### 2026-01-24 05:15:00 - Project Setup

**What was done:**
- Created `specs/` directory structure
- Copied master plan to `specs/plan.md` (9,379 lines)
- Created initial PRD (`specs/prd.md`) with 11 phase generation tasks
- Created `specs/phases/` directory for phase-specific PRDs
- Created `specs/manifest.json` for automatic phase tracking and transitions
- Updated `PROMPT.md` to:
  - Read active PRD from manifest
  - Handle automatic phase transitions when PRD is complete
  - Support both planning and implementation workflows
- Moved activity.md to `logs/activity.md`
- Updated `.gitignore` to ignore logs/ except activity.md

**Phase PRDs to be generated:**
1. Foundation - Project setup, Tauri, basic types
2. Data Layer - Repository pattern, SQLite, migrations
3. State Machine - statig, transitions, side effects
4. Agentic Client - Agent abstraction, Claude client
5. Frontend Core - React, Zustand, Tauri bindings
6. Kanban UI - TaskBoard, drag-drop, cards
7. Agent System - Agents, skills, hooks, plugin
8. QA System - QA prep/testing, visual verification
9. Review & Supervision - Review, watchdog, human-in-loop
10. Ideation System - Chat, ideation, proposals, priority
11. Extensibility - Workflows, methodologies, artifacts

**Next Steps:**
- Run `./ralph.sh 11` to generate all phase PRDs
- Each iteration creates one phase PRD from the master plan
- After PRD generation complete, switch specs/prd.md to point to Phase 1
