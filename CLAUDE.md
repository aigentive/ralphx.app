## Priority Zero — Owner Strategy Alignment (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Before ANY user-facing content, documentation, UI copy, or messaging work, agents must probe these optional files with non-failing file checks and load any that exist:
- `~/.ralphx/founder/founder-profile.md` — Owner vision and non-negotiables
- `~/.ralphx/strategy/project-goal-card.md` — Messaging architecture, positioning, ICPs, competitive landscape
- `~/.ralphx/strategy/project-metrics.md` — Verifiable project data points

If one is missing, skip it and continue; do not fail work or run bare `sed`/`cat` commands that turn absence into a task error. Present files are the **owner's directives** and override default agent judgment on messaging. Do not keep them as always-on `@` imports in project memory.

CodeQL path safety applies to production and tests; use process-owned runtime roots, fixed entry lists, pure test builders, and suppress `rust/path-injection` only after containment validation.
Production CLI resolution applies to installed app launches; all runtime subprocess binaries must go through the shared resolver surface.

## Context And Delegation

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Load narrowly | Read project instructions plus files relevant to the current scope; use bounded delegation when the live harness exposes it and parallel work is genuinely independent. |
| Follow the live profile | Agent conversation Plan profile is read-only; implementation profiles may edit. Do not infer Claude Team/Task behavior on Codex or native delegation paths. |
| Canonical delegation topology | `agents/<agent>/agent.yaml` `delegation.allowed_targets` owns RalphX-native delegation; see `.claude/rules/delegation-topology.md`. |
| Preserve context | Keep durable global invariants here; volatile status belongs in trackers and specialized behavior belongs in path-scoped rules or agent prompts. |

## MCP Architecture
Two MCP servers — different audiences. Full disambiguation: `.claude/rules/mcp-servers.md`
```
Internal: RalphX harness → internal MCP adapter → HTTP :3847 → Tauri Backend
External: Third-party bot → Bearer token → ralphx-external-mcp (:3848) → HTTP :3847 → Tauri Backend
```
Claude plugin: `plugins/app/` | Canonical agent capabilities: `agents/<agent>/agent.yaml` | Tool rules: `.claude/rules/agent-mcp-tools.md`
**MCP server build (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** After modifying ANY source in `plugins/app/ralphx-mcp-server/src/` or `plugins/app/ralphx-external-mcp/src/`, rebuild the respective server. ❌ Committing without rebuilding.
**MCP capability ownership (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** canonical per-agent grants live in `agents/<agent>/agent.yaml` `capabilities.mcp_tools`; `config/ralphx.yaml` holds only explicitly documented compatibility rows.
**Agent frontmatter tool fields (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** Only `tools` and `disallowedTools` are valid in agent `.md` frontmatter. ❌ `allowedTools` — silently ignored by Claude Code. Add MCP tools (e.g., `"mcp__ralphx__*"`) to the `tools` list. Note: `--allowedTools` IS valid as a CLI flag at spawn time — only invalid as frontmatter.

## Key Principles

| # | Rule |
|---|------|
| 0 | **Pattern alignment first (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** Before ANY bug fix or feature, locate the owning service/component and its established pattern (subtree CLAUDE.md pattern tables, `.claude/rules/*`, `docs/architecture/`) and extend that seam. ❌ Parallel services/managers/stores when an existing seam owns the domain. A genuinely new pattern requires explicit justification in the PR body + a one-liner added to the relevant CLAUDE.md (rule 11) |
| 1 | TDD mandatory — tests FIRST |
| 1.5 | **Orchestration chain tests** — see `src-tauri/CLAUDE.md` Integration Tests section |
| 2 | Anti-AI-slop — see Design System section |
| 3 | Clean architecture — domain has no infra deps |
| 4 | Type safety — strict TS, newtype IDs in Rust |
| 5 | ❌ Fragile string comparisons — use enum variants (`matches!(err, MyError::Variant)`), error codes, or named constants for external strings |
| 6 | Full timestamps in activity log |
| 7 | Live workflow status changes → validated `TaskTransitionService::transition_task*` or canonical state-machine/merge-engine writes only. ❌ Direct repo/DB `internal_status` mutation. Nonstandard repair jumps → explicit `transition_task_corrective()` / `apply_corrective_transition()` only |
| 8 | **Focused local validation (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** Run the narrowest tests/checks covering changed behavior and fix current-scope failures. Never use a full suite as fallback when targeted discovery is uncertain; use the nearest module/suite/crate check or report no applicable local test. Broad Rust suites, dual clippy, doctests, coverage, and PR/main parity belong to RalphX workspace CI/autofix unless explicitly requested or reproducing a named CI failure. Report unrelated pre-existing failures without expanding scope. Details: `.claude/rules/rust-test-execution.md` |
| 8.5 | **Post-Rust-test cleanup (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** If any Rust test command starts (`cargo test`, `cargo nextest run`, Rust coverage, or a wrapper that executes Rust tests), run `cd src-tauri && cargo clean` separately in the active workspace once after the final or aborted test attempt and before handoff, whether it succeeds, fails, times out, is cancelled, or is interrupted; no Rust test means no cleanup. Report cleanup failure and never manually delete target directories as a fallback. Details: `.claude/rules/rust-test-execution.md` |
| 9 | **Visual QA default (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** Prefer automated Playwright visual tests; agents may start/stop only the scoped dev servers those tests require. Native Tauri QA through Computer Use is prohibited unless the user explicitly requests it in the current request; never infer permission from UI/theme scope or other repository guidance. Details: `.claude/rules/visual-testing.md` |
| 10 | Implementation playbook: `DEVELOPMENT.md` — read alongside CLAUDE.md files for placement, naming, recipes, and debugging. |
| 11 | New pattern → add one-liner to relevant CLAUDE.md. Pattern name + rule only. |
| 12 | Complex work → use the task/ledger surface exposed by the active harness; Claude Task management details → `.claude/rules/task-management.md` |
| 13 | Parallel commits → coordinate via normal git hygiene and verify `git status` / `git diff` before committing; no lock-file protocol |
| 14 | Tauri invoke: camelCase fields. ✅ `contextId` ❌ `context_id` |
| 15 | New `.claude/rules/*` / `CLAUDE.md` → frontmatter line 1; maintainer note next |
| 16 | **DbConnection (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** All SQLite repo methods MUST use `db.run(\|conn\| { ... })` via `DbConnection` for non-blocking access. ❌ Direct `conn.lock().await` / `conn.query_row()` in async methods. See `db_connection.rs`. |
| 17 | **Tokio spawn safety (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** `tokio::spawn` / `tokio::task::spawn` / `spawn_blocking` → async context ONLY. Sync constructors & Tauri setup → `std::thread::spawn` or `tauri::async_runtime::spawn`. Details: `.claude/rules/tokio-runtime-safety.md` |
| 18 | **Rust std API stability (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** Avoid unstable std APIs in production code (e.g., `is_multiple_of`). Use stable equivalents (e.g., `%`). Details: `.claude/rules/rust-stable-apis.md` |
| 19 | **UI design parity (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** Theme/layout changes → use explicit WebKit-safe bg/border longhands and prefer Playwright visual coverage. Native Tauri/WKWebView QA through Computer Use requires an explicit user request per rule 9. Details: `.claude/rules/wkwebview-css-vars.md` |
| 20 | **Constraint bundle planning** — Ideation plans should derive repo-specific `Constraints`, `Avoid`, and `Proof Obligations` from explored architecture before verification. |
| 21 | **Mechanical extractions only (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** For large refactors/splits, move existing code with real extraction commands/scripts first (`mv`, `sed`, `awk`, scripted extraction). `apply_patch` is only for the small post-move fix-up layer, never for hand-recreating large existing bodies. Details: `.claude/rules/code-quality-standards.md` |
| 22 | **WKWebView CSS vars (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** Theme tokens for bg/text/border MUST use literal color values (`#rrggbb`, `hsl()`, `hsla()`) — ❌ chained `var(--primitive)`. WKWebView drops chained var() on inheritance. Every new `[data-theme="X"]` block needs a defensive `html[data-theme="X"]` canvas paint rule. Prefer Playwright visual coverage; only perform Native Tauri QA through Computer Use when the user explicitly requests it. Details: `.claude/rules/wkwebview-css-vars.md` |
| 23 | **Icon-only buttons:** Must have an accessible name and the app tooltip component; native `title` alone is not enough. Details: `.claude/rules/icon-only-buttons.md` |
| 24 | **Frontend interaction performance (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** User-triggered panes/drawers/widgets must paint a lightweight shell before lazy imports, fetches, persistence, process startup, or heavy mount/unmount work; warm up likely heavy paths on safe intent/idle; fix safe current-scope opportunities with TDD. Details: `.claude/rules/frontend-interaction-performance.md` |
| 25 | **Stateful workflow review (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** For completion/cache/retry/recovery/state-machine changes, prove current-attempt authority, fail-closed reads, event ordering, prompt/schema alignment, path containment, and production-path tests. Details: `.claude/rules/stateful-workflow-review.md` |
| 26 | **Big-PR review checklist:** Before merging any large feature/refactor PR, run the 12 falsifiable checks in `.claude/rules/big-pr-review-checklist.md` — they target the 11 failure classes big PRs here actually ship (scope leaks, stale-metadata trust, competing UI writers, UI-inferred state, recovery-path divergence, …) |

## Adversarial Plan Convergence (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Plan-verification run/round/gap lineage and terminal classification are backend-owned; the active model may choose permitted lenses/delegates but must not replay orchestration bookkeeping. Follow `.claude/rules/ideation-verification-architecture.md` and the live profile prompt; implementation still requires the product's user-confirmation gate.

## Design System
`specs/design/styleguide.md` (tokens, components, layout rules — initial spec, grows with app) | `specs/DESIGN.md` | Accent: `#ff6b35` (warm orange) ❌ purple/blue | Font: SF Pro ❌ Inter
