# Release Script Validation

## Rules

| # | Rule |
|---|------|
| 1 | **Main checkout validation stays local-only** — use `bash -n`, `--help`, `./scripts/propose-release.sh --context-only`, and `./scripts/generate-release-notes.sh --context-only --output <tmp>` in the real repo. |
| 2 | **Wrapper e2e runs use a disposable stub repo** — validate `./scripts/release.sh` end-to-end only in a temp repo/worktree with a fake `codex` binary and stubbed release scripts. ❌ Full wrapper run in the main checkout. |
| 3 | **No publish side effects during validation** — stop before tag creation, `git push`, workflow dispatch, Homebrew/update publication, or any other release action. |
| 4 | **Stored version state is test input** — `.artifacts/release-notes/.version` is local/gitignored, affects no-arg `bump-version.sh` and `generate-release-notes.sh`, and must never be committed. |
| 5 | **Interface changes require doc sync** — if release script flags, prompts, or artifact paths change, update `docs/release-process.md` and `release-notes/README.md` in the same slice. |
