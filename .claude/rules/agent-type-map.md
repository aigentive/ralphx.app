# Agent Type Map

> **Maintainer note:** This file optimizes for LLM context efficiency. Rules: (1) Tables > prose (2) One example max per concept (3) No redundant explanations (4) Use symbols: → = leads to, | = or, ❌/✅ = wrong/right (5) Before adding content, ask: "Can this be a single line?" If yes, make it one line.

## Agent Context Types

Source of truth: `ChatContextType` (Rust: `domain/entities/chat_conversation.rs`) | `ContextType` (TS: `types/chat-conversation.ts`)

| Context Type | Store Key Prefix | Execution Slot | Streaming | Subagents | Diff Views | Queue | Team Mode | Pipeline Stage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ideation` | `session:` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| `task` | `task:` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | — |
| `project` | `project:` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | — |
| `task_execution` | `task_execution:` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Executing → ReExecuting |
| `review` | `review:` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | PendingReview → Reviewing |
| `merge` | `merge:` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | PendingMerge → Merging |

**Execution slot** = counted against `max_concurrent` in `uses_execution_slot()` (`chat_service/mod.rs`).

## Verification Specialist Extensibility Pattern

Adding a new specialist to the plan verification pipeline requires these 7 steps:

| Step | File | Change |
|------|------|--------|
| 1 | `agents/<name>/...` | Create canonical agent config + prompt files with role/scope/refuse boundaries and output format |
| 2 | `ralphx.yaml` | Register agent: model, tools, mcp_tools, disallowedTools |
| 3 | `plugins/app/ralphx-mcp-server/src/agentNames.ts` | Add `export const IDEATION_SPECIALIST_<NAME> = "<name>"` constant |
| 4 | `plugins/app/ralphx-mcp-server/src/tools.ts` | Import constant; add `[IDEATION_SPECIALIST_<NAME>]: [...]` to TOOL_ALLOWLIST |
| 5 | `agents/ralphx-plan-verifier/claude/prompt.md` + `ralphx.yaml` | Keep the Claude prompt contract and runtime grants aligned for `Task(ralphx:<name>)` |
| 6 | `ralphx.yaml` ralphx-plan-verifier entry | Add `Task(ralphx:<name>)` to `preapproved_cli_tools` array |
| 7 | `agents/ralphx-plan-verifier/claude/prompt.md` | Add signal → specialist mapping in dynamic role selection section |

**Two specialist dispatch modes:**
| Mode | When | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| **Pre-round enrichment** (Step 0.5) | Runs ONCE before adversarial loop; results injected into plan context | `ralphx-ideation-specialist-code-quality` — unconditionally when plan references existing code files; `ralphx-ideation-specialist-intent` — unconditionally for ALL plans (no Affected Files gate) |
| **Per-round parallel** | Runs alongside critics in each round; selected by signal | `ralphx-ideation-specialist-ux` — `.tsx`/`.ts` in `src/`; `ralphx-ideation-specialist-prompt-quality` — `.md` in `agents/`/`prompts/`; `ralphx-ideation-specialist-pipeline-safety` — `side_effects/`/`task_transition_service.rs`/`on_enter_states/`/`chat_service_merge.rs`/`chat_service_streaming.rs`; `ralphx-ideation-specialist-state-machine` — `task_transition_service.rs`/`on_enter_states/` or new pipeline stages |

**Signal mapping rules (per-round specialists):** Scan `## Affected Files` and `## Architecture` sections only (not full plan text). Return: specialist name, trigger signal, signal source. Per-round specialists run in parallel with critics — failure is non-blocking. Specialists create artifacts on the **parent ideation session_id** (not the verification child session_id) so they appear in the Team Artifacts tab.

## Cross-Project Tool Chain

Full ordered sequence when an ideation session detects cross-project targets:

| Step | Tool | Purpose | Agents with Access |
|------|------|---------|-------------------|
| 1 | `cross_project_guide` | Detect if plan spans multiple projects; gate for all subsequent cross-project tools | `ralphx-ideation`, `ralphx-ideation-team-lead` |
| 2 | `list_projects` | Discover available target projects by ID/name | `ralphx-ideation`, `ralphx-ideation-team-lead` |
| 3 | `ask_user_question` | Confirm target project selection with user | `ralphx-ideation`, `ralphx-ideation-team-lead` |
| 4 | `create_cross_project_session` | Create a new ideation session in the target project (requires plan verification = Verified/Skipped/ImportedVerified) | `ralphx-ideation`, `ralphx-ideation-team-lead` |
| 5 | `create_task_proposal` (with `target_project`) | Create proposals in source session; set `target_project` field on each cross-project proposal | `ralphx-ideation`, `ralphx-ideation-team-lead` |
| 6 | `migrate_proposals` | Move cross-project proposals to their target session; call once per target session after proposals are created | `ralphx-ideation`, `ralphx-ideation-team-lead` |
| 7 | `finalize_proposals` (per session) | Finalize each session separately — source session first, then each target session | `ralphx-ideation`, `ralphx-ideation-team-lead` |

**Constraints:** `cross_project_guide` must be called before `create_task_proposal` when a cross-project plan exists (`cross_project_checked` gate). `create_cross_project_session` requires plan verification = Verified/Skipped/ImportedVerified.

## Agent Frontmatter MCP Tool Rule (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Agent frontmatter `tools:` MUST use explicit `mcp__ralphx__<tool>` entries — ❌ `mcp__ralphx__*` wildcards. The `ralphx.yaml` `mcp_tools` array is the source of truth.

**Why:** Wildcard doesn't reliably resolve; agents get "tool doesn't exist" for valid tools. All three layers must include the tool: frontmatter → `ralphx.yaml` `mcp_tools` → MCP server TOOL_ALLOWLIST.

\`\`\`yaml
# ✅ Explicit entries in agent frontmatter
tools:
  - mcp__ralphx__get_task_context
  - mcp__ralphx__execution_complete

# ❌ Wildcard — unreliable resolution
tools:
  - mcp__ralphx__*
\`\`\`

**Spot-check (2026-03-20):** `ralphx-execution-worker` (23 tools ✅), `ralphx-execution-reviewer` (15 tools ✅), `ralphx-execution-merger` (9 tools ✅) — all frontmatter entries match `ralphx.yaml` exactly.

## Agent Lifecycle Events

All handled by `useAgentEvents` hook (`src/hooks/useAgentEvents.ts`).

| Event | Source | State Transition | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `agent:run_started` | Agent process spawned | `idle` → `generating` | Sets active conversation |
| `agent:conversation_created` | Backend conversation creation | — (query invalidation) | Fires when new ChatConversation row is created. Frontend invalidates conversation list. |
| `agent:message_created` | Agent produces output | — (query invalidation) | Appends to message list |
| `agent:turn_completed` | Agent finishes one turn | `generating` → `waiting_for_input` | Agent alive, awaiting user input |
| `agent:run_completed` | Agent process exits | `*` → `idle` | Flushes queued messages |
| `agent:queue_sent` | Queued message delivered | — (removes from queue) | Matches by content hash |
| `agent:stopped` | User stops agent | `*` → `idle` | User-initiated stop |
| `agent:error` | Agent crash/error | `*` → `idle` | Toast for execution/review/merge |
| `agent:session_recovered` | Session recovery | — (info toast) | Notification only |

## Frontend State: AgentStatus (Tri-State)

Defined in `stores/chatStore.ts`. Keyed by store key (e.g., `"task_execution:task-123"`).

```
AgentStatus = "idle" | "generating" | "waiting_for_input"
```

| Status | Meaning | UI | Queue Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| `idle` | No agent process | Hidden / activity icon | Direct send |
| `generating` | Agent producing output | Spinner + "Agent responding..." | Queue message |
| `waiting_for_input` | Agent alive, between turns | Pause icon + "Awaiting input" | Direct send |

**Selectors:**
- `selectAgentStatus(key)` → `AgentStatus` (tri-state)
- `selectIsAgentRunning(key)` → `boolean` (true for both `generating` and `waiting_for_input` — backward compat)

## Store Key Construction

`buildStoreKey(contextType, contextId)` from `lib/chat-context-registry.ts`:

| Context Type | Key Format | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `ideation` | `session:{sessionId}` | `session:abc-123` |
| `task` | `task:{taskId}` | `task:task-456` |
| `project` | `project:{projectId}` | `project:proj-789` |
| `task_execution` | `task_execution:{taskId}` | `task_execution:task-456` |
| `review` | `review:{taskId}` | `review:task-456` |
| `merge` | `merge:{taskId}` | `merge:task-456` |
