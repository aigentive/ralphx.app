# Release Notes

This directory holds curated release notes that the release workflow will use automatically when a matching file exists.

Naming convention:

- `release-notes/v0.2.0.md`
- `release-notes/v0.2.1.md`
- `release-notes/v0.100.42.md`

Typical flow:

1. For local release prep, prefer the guided wrapper:
   - `./scripts/release.sh`
2. Review the proposal when prompted, accept it to continue, then review and edit the generated `release-notes/vX.Y.Z.md`
3. Commit it before tagging if you want the workflow-created draft release to use it automatically

Daily scheduled releases:

- `Daily Release` runs from `main`, skips when there are no commits after the latest reachable `vX.Y.Z` tag, and commits the generated `release-notes/vX.Y.Z.md` before tagging.
- The scheduled workflow uses Codex CLI for both the version proposal and release-note generation, so the repository needs a `CODEX_API_KEY` secret.
- Protected-main setups may also need `RELEASE_AUTOMATION_TOKEN` with `contents:write` and `actions:write` so the workflow can push the release-prep commit/tag and dispatch `Release Build`.
- Manual `Daily Release` dispatch supports `dry_run=true` to verify generation without committing, tagging, pushing, or dispatching `Release Build`.
- Manual `Daily Release` dispatch supports `release_bump` to force `patch`, `minor`, or `major`; selecting `major` is explicit release-owner approval.
- Manual `Daily Release` dispatch also supports `release_version` to force an exact version; do not combine it with `release_bump`.
- Maintenance-only commits can avoid scheduled release prep when every commit after the latest tag includes `[skip daily-release]`, `[skip release]`, `[no daily-release]`, or `[no release]`.

Notes:

- Release proposals default to `.artifacts/release-notes/proposal-from-v<current-version>.md`
- Accepted release versions are stored in `.artifacts/release-notes/.version` (local/gitignored)
- RalphX.app expects a long-lived `0.x.y` line; multi-digit pre-1.0 versions such as `0.42.0` and `0.100.42` are valid.
- Generated notes should put user-facing changes first and developer/maintainer work in a separate `Developer And Maintainer Changes` section near the bottom.
- `./scripts/propose-release.sh`, `./scripts/bump-version.sh`, and `./scripts/generate-release-notes.sh` still work as standalone lower-level steps
- Generated drafts should keep commit traceability as clickable Markdown links
- Codex generation logs are written to `.artifacts/release-notes/logs/`
- The full release sequence lives in `docs/release-process.md`
