// Migration v54: Add inherited_plan_artifact_id column to ideation_sessions
//
// Separates owned vs inherited plan artifacts for child sessions.
// When a child session inherits a parent's plan via `inherit_context: true`:
//   - plan_artifact_id = None (child has no own plan yet)
//   - inherited_plan_artifact_id = parent's plan artifact ID (read-only)
//
// Data migration: For existing child sessions where plan_artifact_id matches
// the parent's artifact, move to inherited_plan_artifact_id and set
// plan_artifact_id = NULL.
