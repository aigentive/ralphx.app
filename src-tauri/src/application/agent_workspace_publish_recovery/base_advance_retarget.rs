//! Retargets an interrupted-but-clean workspace repair onto a base that moved while it ran.
//!
//! There are deliberately two sources of truth here, and they answer different questions:
//!
//! - [`super::pr_autofix_redelivery::repair_base_advanced`] is the cheap durable predicate. It
//!   compares the generation's `target_base_commit` against a caller-supplied observed base (the
//!   live GitHub base in `evaluate_pr_autofix_successor`, the Git-read advanced base here) and
//!   answers *should we consider retargeting at all*.
//! - The completion classifier answers *onto exactly which commit*, because it read real Git. The
//!   durable `workspace.base_commit` can itself be stale, so the classifier's commit always wins.
//!
//! When the two disagree the classifier still decides and the divergence is logged, because a
//! silent preference between two disagreeing sources is how stale base state becomes invisible.
