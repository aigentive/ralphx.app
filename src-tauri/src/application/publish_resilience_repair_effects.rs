//! Durable repair-effect identity resolution and orphaned-effect termination.

//! A repair attempt may hold at most one open effect at a time, so a durable effect that its
//! owning process abandoned fences every recovery exit for that attempt. These helpers resolve
//! which effect currently represents a given effect kind (base key or an ordinal retry key), and
//! terminate the one orphaned shape that is provably safe to replay.
