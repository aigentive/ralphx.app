//! Git Service - Branch, worktree, and merge operations for task isolation
//!
//! Provides git operations for per-task branch isolation:
//! - Branch creation, checkout, and deletion (both modes)
//! - Worktree management (Worktree mode only)
//! - Commit operations with configurable messages
//! - Rebase and merge operations for the two-phase merge workflow
//! - Checkout-free merge operations (git plumbing, no working tree mutation)
//! - Query operations for commits and diff stats
