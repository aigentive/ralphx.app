//! Port for evicting cached project statistics when a task changes state.
//!
//! The stats caches themselves are owned by the command layer, but the state
//! machine is what knows a task moved. Rather than have `domain` import
//! `commands`, the domain owns this slot and the command layer registers an
//! implementation during startup.
//!
//! Formalized as a first-class `StatsCacheInvalidator` port in phase 10.
