// Question repository trait - domain layer abstraction for question persistence
//
// This trait defines the contract for persisting pending questions (from AskUserQuestion).
// SQLite stores data for restart resilience + audit trail; in-memory channels remain for signaling.
// Types imported from crate::application::question_state.
