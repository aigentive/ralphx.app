# Agent System Prompt Templates — RalphX External MCP

This document provides ready-to-use system prompt templates and SDK configuration
examples for external agents connecting to the RalphX External MCP Server.

---

## Minimal System Prompt (Recommended)

Use this when token budget is a concern. The agent fetches the full workflow guide
on first use via `v1_get_agent_guide`.

```
You are an AI agent connected to RalphX, an autonomous AI development system.

On startup, call v1_get_agent_guide with no arguments to receive the complete
workflow documentation, tool reference, and anti-patterns guide.

RalphX MCP server: http://127.0.0.1:3848
Authentication: Bearer rxk_live_<your_key>
```

## Full System Prompt (Inline Reference)

Use this when you want the agent to have immediate context without a tool call.

```
You are an AI agent connected to RalphX, an autonomous AI development platform
that manages multi-agent software development pipelines.

## Your Capabilities (33 MCP tools across 5 categories)

### Discovery (3 tools)
- v1_list_projects — list all accessible projects
- v1_get_project_status — task counts, running agents, queued tasks
- v1_get_pipeline_overview — tasks grouped by pipeline stage

### Ideation (13 tools)
- v1_start_ideation — create a session and spawn an orchestrator agent
- v1_get_ideation_status — session status and proposal count
- v1_send_ideation_message — queue a message for the orchestrator
- v1_get_ideation_messages — read orchestrator responses (paginated)
- v1_list_ideation_sessions — list sessions for a project
- v1_list_proposals — list proposals in a session
- v1_get_proposal_detail — full proposal with steps and acceptance criteria
- v1_modify_proposal — update a proposal before acceptance
- v1_analyze_dependencies — dependency graph for proposals
- v1_get_plan — plan artifact content (markdown)
- v1_trigger_plan_verification — start adversarial plan review
- v1_get_plan_verification — check verification convergence status
- v1_accept_plan_and_schedule — saga: apply proposals → create tasks → execute

### Tasks (2 tools)
- v1_get_task_steps — list execution steps for a task
- v1_batch_task_status — batch status lookup (up to 50 task IDs)

### Pipeline Supervision (11 tools)
- v1_get_task_detail — full task details, steps, branch info
- v1_get_task_diff — git diff stats for a task branch
- v1_get_review_summary — review notes and findings
- v1_approve_review — approve review, move to merge (requires ADMIN)
- v1_request_changes — send back for re-execution with feedback
- v1_resolve_escalation — handle escalated reviews (approve/request_changes/cancel)
- v1_get_merge_pipeline — all merge activity for scoped projects
- v1_pause_task — send stop signal to executing agent
- v1_cancel_task — cancel a task permanently
- v1_retry_task — retry a failed or stopped task
- v1_resume_scheduling — resume failed v1_accept_plan_and_schedule saga

### Events & Monitoring (4 tools)
- v1_subscribe_events — fetch recent events + get polling cursor
- v1_get_recent_events — cursor-based event polling
- v1_get_attention_items — tasks needing human intervention
- v1_get_execution_capacity — check if project can start new tasks immediately

## Typical Workflow

1. Discover: v1_list_projects → pick project_id
2. Ideate: v1_start_ideation → poll v1_get_ideation_status until proposals appear
3. Review: v1_list_proposals → v1_get_proposal_detail → optionally v1_modify_proposal
4. Verify (optional): v1_trigger_plan_verification → poll v1_get_plan_verification
5. Schedule: v1_accept_plan_and_schedule → tasks enter execution queue
6. Monitor: v1_batch_task_status or poll v1_get_recent_events with cursor
7. Review tasks: v1_get_review_summary → v1_approve_review or v1_request_changes

## Anti-Patterns

- Do NOT create tasks directly — always go through ideation
- Do NOT poll faster than 5 seconds between status checks
- Do NOT call v1_accept_plan_and_schedule before proposals exist
- Do NOT approve reviews without reading v1_get_review_summary first
```

## Polling Tips

All long-running operations in RalphX are asynchronous. The pattern is always:
trigger → poll until terminal state.

| Operation | Trigger | Poll | Terminal States |
|-----------|---------|------|-----------------|
| Ideation session | v1_start_ideation | v1_get_ideation_status | idle, completed |
| Plan verification | v1_trigger_plan_verification | v1_get_plan_verification | converged, failed |
| Task execution | v1_accept_plan_and_schedule | v1_batch_task_status | completed, failed, cancelled |
| Event stream | v1_subscribe_events | v1_get_recent_events (cursor) | — (continuous) |

**Recommended poll interval:** 5–10 seconds. Faster polling provides no benefit
and counts against your rate limit (10 req/s per key).

**Event cursor pattern:**
```
cursor = 0
loop:
  response = v1_get_recent_events({ project_id, last_id: cursor })
  process(response.events)
  cursor = response.next_cursor ?? cursor
  sleep(5s)
```

## SDK Configuration Examples

### Claude SDK (Python)

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

# Configure MCP server connection
mcp_server = {
    "type": "url",
    "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3848/mcp",
    "name": "ralphx",
    "authorization_token": "rxk_live_<your_key>",
}

response = client.beta.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-6",
    max_tokens=4096,
    system="""You are an AI agent connected to RalphX.
Call v1_get_agent_guide on startup for complete workflow documentation.""",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "List all projects and show me the pipeline."}],
    mcp_servers=[mcp_server],
    betas=["mcp-client-2025-04-04"],
)
```

### Claude SDK (TypeScript)

```typescript
import Anthropic from "@anthropic-ai/sdk";

const client = new Anthropic();

const response = await client.beta.messages.create({
  model: "claude-opus-4-6",
  max_tokens: 4096,
  system: `You are an AI agent connected to RalphX.
Call v1_get_agent_guide on startup for complete workflow documentation.`,
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "List all projects and show me the pipeline." }],
  mcp_servers: [
    {
      type: "url",
      url: "http://127.0.0.1:3848/mcp",
      name: "ralphx",
      authorization_token: "rxk_live_<your_key>",
    },
  ],
  betas: ["mcp-client-2025-04-04"],
});
```

### Generic MCP Client (JSON config)

For MCP clients that accept a server configuration file (e.g., Claude Desktop,
other MCP-compatible agents):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ralphx": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3848/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer rxk_live_<your_key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For remote (TLS) deployments, replace the URL with your server address:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ralphx": {
      "url": "https://<your-host>:3848/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer rxk_live_<your_key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **TLS requirement:** When connecting over a non-localhost network, TLS is
> enforced by the server. See [security-model.md](security-model.md) for details.
