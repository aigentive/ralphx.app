# Active Plan Feature

## Overview

The **Active Plan** feature allows you to focus your work by selecting a single ideation session (plan) to view across RalphX. When you select an active plan, both the Kanban board and Graph view filter to show only tasks from that plan, helping you maintain focus and avoid context switching.

## Key Concepts

### What is an Active Plan?

An active plan is an ideation session that has been "accepted" and converted to tasks. Each project can have one active plan at a time. The active plan selection:

- **Persists across app restarts** — Your selection is saved in the database
- **Is project-scoped** — Each project has its own active plan
- **Filters both Graph and Kanban** — Both views show only tasks from the active plan
- **Can be changed anytime** — Switch plans quickly using the inline selector or keyboard shortcut

### Plan Eligibility

Only **accepted** ideation sessions can be selected as active plans:

- ✅ Sessions with status = "accepted" and tasks created
- ❌ Active sessions (still in ideation mode)
- ❌ Archived sessions

## How to Select a Plan

### Method 1: Inline Plan Selector

The inline plan selector appears in both the Kanban toolbar and Graph controls area.

**Features:**
- Shows current plan title and task count badge
- Opens a searchable dropdown of all accepted plans
- Displays task statistics (incomplete/total tasks)
- Shows "Active" badge for plans with tasks in progress
- Includes "Clear selection" option to remove filtering

**Steps:**
1. Click the plan selector button in the toolbar
2. Type to search for a plan (optional)
3. Click a plan to select it
4. Use keyboard navigation (↑/↓ arrows + Enter) if preferred

**Compact Mode:**
In tight layouts, the selector shows an icon-only button to save space.

### Method 2: Quick Switcher (Keyboard)

Press **`Cmd+Shift+P`** (Mac) or **`Ctrl+Shift+P`** (Windows/Linux) to open the plan quick switcher.

**Features:**
- Non-modal floating panel (no backdrop)
- Type-to-search interface
- Keyboard navigation (↑/↓ arrows + Enter)
- Press `Escape` to close
- Currently active plan is highlighted with a checkmark

**Why Non-Modal?**
The quick switcher is designed as a lightweight command palette that doesn't block the UI. You can see your workspace context while switching plans, reducing cognitive load.

## How Plans Are Ranked

When you open the plan selector or quick switcher, plans are ranked using a weighted scoring algorithm that combines three factors:

### 1. Interaction Score (45% weight)

Tracks how often and how recently you've manually selected each plan:

- **Frequency:** More selections = higher score (logarithmic scaling)
- **Recency:** Recent selections boost the score (21-day decay)
- **Formula:** `ln(selection_count + 1) / ln(10) * exp(-days_since / 21)`

### 2. Activity Score (35% weight)

Measures current work activity in the plan:

- **Active tasks:** Plans with tasks in "executing," "review," or "merge" states get a bonus
- **Incomplete ratio:** Plans with more incomplete tasks rank higher
- **Formula:** `0.6 * (has_active_tasks ? 1 : 0) + 0.4 * (incomplete / total)`

### 3. Recency Score (20% weight)

Considers when the plan was accepted (created):

- Newer plans rank higher than older ones
- **Formula:** `exp(-days_since_acceptance / 30)`

### Final Score

```
final_score = 0.45 * interaction_score + 0.35 * activity_score + 0.20 * recency_score
```

**Tie-breakers:**
1. Higher score wins
2. If tied, newer accepted_at timestamp wins
3. If still tied, alphabetical by title

**Result:** Plans you actively use and work on bubble to the top automatically.

## Cross-View Synchronization

The active plan selection is **globally synchronized** across all views:

1. Select a plan in the **Kanban inline selector** → Graph updates immediately
2. Select a plan in the **Graph inline selector** → Kanban updates immediately
3. Select a plan via **quick switcher** → Both views update immediately
4. Accept a plan in **Ideation view** → Becomes active plan, both views filter on navigation

All selection events are tracked with a "source" label (`kanban_inline`, `graph_inline`, `quick_switcher`, `ideation`) for analytics and to power the interaction ranking.

## Empty States

### No Plan Selected

If no active plan is set, both Graph and Kanban show an empty state:

**Graph:**
```
⚠️  No plan selected
Select a plan to view work on the Graph.
[Plan Selector Button]
```

**Kanban:**
```
📄  No plan selected
Select a plan to view work on the Kanban board.
[Plan Selector Button]
or press Cmd+Shift+P
```

### No Accepted Plans Available

If you try to open the selector but have no accepted plans yet:

```
📄  No accepted plans found
Create and accept a plan in the Ideation view first.
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)<br>`Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) | Open plan quick switcher |
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate plans in selector/switcher |
| `Enter` | Select highlighted plan |
| `Escape` | Close selector/switcher |

**Note:** The `Cmd+Shift+P` shortcut is ignored when typing in text inputs or textareas to avoid conflicts.

## Interaction with Other Features

### Archived Tasks

The "Show Archived" toggle in Kanban and Graph respects the active plan filter:

- ✅ Archived tasks **from the active plan** are shown when toggle is on
- ❌ Archived tasks **from other plans** remain hidden

### Task Search

The search bar in Kanban filters only tasks from the active plan:

- If no plan is selected, search returns no results
- Search across all plans is not supported (by design for focus)

### Reopening a Session

If you reopen an ideation session that was previously accepted (and is currently active):

1. The session status changes back to "active"
2. The active plan is **automatically cleared** for the project
3. Graph and Kanban show empty states
4. You must select a different plan to continue working

## Best Practices

### 1. Accept Plans When Ready
Only accept ideation sessions when you're ready to work on them. Accepted plans clutter the selector if they contain no actionable tasks.

### 2. Use Quick Switcher for Fast Context Switching
Train muscle memory for `Cmd+Shift+P` to switch plans without leaving the keyboard. Type a few characters of the plan name to filter instantly.

### 3. Leverage Ranking Intelligence
The ranking algorithm learns from your behavior. Plans you work on frequently will automatically appear at the top, reducing search time.

### 4. Clear Selection When Planning
If you're in ideation mode or reviewing proposals, clear the active plan to prevent confusion. The empty state reminds you no work is currently filtered.

### 5. One Plan Per Project
Remember that active plan is scoped by project. If you work on multiple projects, each project maintains its own active plan selection independently.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "No plan selected" persists after selecting

**Possible Causes:**
1. The selected session was deleted or reopened (status changed)
2. Database connection issue

**Solution:**
1. Check that the session still exists in the Ideation view
2. Try reselecting the plan
3. Restart the app if persistence fails

### Problem: Plan selector shows outdated task counts

**Possible Causes:**
1. Task state changed but selector wasn't refreshed
2. Multiple instances of the app running

**Solution:**
1. Close and reopen the selector dropdown to refresh data
2. Click the refresh icon if available
3. Ensure only one instance of RalphX is running

### Problem: Quick switcher doesn't open with `Cmd+Shift+P`

**Possible Causes:**
1. Another app or system shortcut is capturing the key combination
2. You're typing in a text input (shortcut is intentionally disabled)

**Solution:**
1. Check System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts for conflicts
2. Click outside any input field and try again
3. Use the inline selector as an alternative

### Problem: Selected plan doesn't show any tasks

**Possible Causes:**
1. All tasks in the plan are archived
2. The plan was accepted but no tasks were created
3. Tasks were deleted manually

**Solution:**
1. Toggle "Show Archived" to reveal archived tasks
2. Check the Ideation view to verify tasks were created
3. Select a different plan with active tasks

### Problem: Ranking seems incorrect

**Possible Causes:**
1. Selection tracking data is missing (fresh install or DB migration)
2. Task stats are out of sync

**Solution:**
1. Use the plan a few times to build selection history
2. Ranking will improve as you interact with plans
3. Manually select frequently-used plans to boost their ranking

## Technical Details (for advanced users)

### Database Tables

**`project_active_plan`**
- Stores one active plan per project
- Primary key: `project_id`
- Foreign keys: `ideation_session_id` (cascades on delete)

**`plan_selection_stats`**
- Tracks selection frequency and recency per project-plan pair
- Composite primary key: `(project_id, ideation_session_id)`
- Columns: `selected_count`, `last_selected_at`, `last_selected_source`

### API Commands

- `get_active_plan(project_id)` → Returns session ID or null
- `set_active_plan(project_id, session_id, source)` → Sets active plan and records selection
- `clear_active_plan(project_id)` → Removes active plan for project

### State Management

Frontend state is managed by `planStore` (Zustand):
- `activePlanByProject: Record<string, string | null>` — Maps project IDs to active session IDs
- `planCandidates: PlanCandidate[]` — Cached list of selectable plans with stats
- `loadCandidates(projectId, query?)` — Loads and ranks plans (backend call)
- `setActivePlan(projectId, sessionId, source)` — Updates active plan (backend + store)
- `clearActivePlan(projectId)` — Clears active plan (backend + store)

### Selection Source Tracking

Every plan selection records its source:
- `kanban_inline` — Selected from Kanban toolbar
- `graph_inline` — Selected from Graph controls
- `quick_switcher` — Selected via `Cmd+Shift+P` palette
- `ideation` — Auto-selected when accepting a session

This data powers interaction scoring and enables future analytics features.
