# Ideation Studio User Guide

The Ideation Studio is where every feature in RalphX begins. You describe what you want to build, and a team of AI agents researches your codebase, designs an implementation plan, and creates a set of ready-to-execute tasks. Those tasks then flow automatically through execution, review, and the merge pipeline — turning an idea into merged code with minimal manual intervention.

---

## Quick Reference

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| How do I start? | Open the Ideation view, click **New Session**, describe what you want to build. |
| Which mode should I choose? | **Solo** for quick fixes and simple features. **Research Team** for anything touching 2+ layers. **Debate Team** for architecture decisions. |
| What happens after I approve the plan? | RalphX creates tasks automatically and sets the plan as your Active Plan — tasks appear on Kanban and Graph immediately. |
| Can I edit a proposal before tasks are created? | Yes — proposals are shown in the CONFIRM phase. Reject the plan or ask for changes before approving. |
| Can I message individual team members? | Yes — use the Team Activity panel to send a message to the lead or any specialist directly. |
| What is an Active Plan? | A focused filter. Selecting an accepted ideation session as your Active Plan makes Kanban and Graph show only tasks from that plan. |
| Where do tasks go after the plan is accepted? | Into the execution pipeline: Pending → Executing → QA → Review → Approved → PendingMerge → Merged. |
| What's the full journey? | Ideation → Plan → Tasks → Execution → Review → **Merge Pipeline** → Done. |

## Overview

RalphX structures feature development as a gated pipeline. The Ideation Studio is the entry point — the stage where a human idea becomes a concrete, costed, dependency-ordered set of tasks:

```
You describe a feature
        |
        v
  Ideation Studio
  (plan + proposals)
        |
        v
  Active Plan selected
        |
        v
  Tasks on Kanban / Graph
        |
        v
  Execution  →  Review  →  Merge Pipeline  →  Merged Code
```

The AI orchestrator (or a team of agents in team mode) does the research and planning work. You stay in control through two hard checkpoints: the **CONFIRM gate** (approve the plan before proposals are created) and the **Review gate** (approve code before it merges).

---

## Starting an Ideation Session

### How to Start

1. Open the **Ideation** view in the left sidebar
2. Click **New Session**
3. Type what you want to build in the text area
4. Choose an **Ideation Mode** (see below)
5. Click **Start Session**

The orchestrator begins immediately. You will see the session's chat panel fill with activity as it researches your codebase.

### Session Modes

| Mode | Who runs the research | Best for | Est. token cost |
|------|-----------------------|----------|-----------------|
| **Solo** | 1 orchestrator + up to 3 parallel Explore subagents | Simple features, bug fix ideation, quick tasks | ~100K (~$0.80) |
| **Research Team** ★ | 1 team lead (Opus) + up to 5 dynamic specialist teammates | Complex features touching 2+ layers (frontend + backend + DB) | ~350–400K (~$2.50–3.50) |
| **Debate Team** ★ | 1 team lead (Opus) + up to 5 dynamic advocate teammates (including a devil's advocate) | Architecture decisions, new subsystems, high-stakes design | ~500–600K (~$4.00–5.00) |

**★ = Recommended for complex work.** For a project like RalphX, using more compute on non-trivial features reduces integration failures and missed edge cases.

### Team Configuration

When you select Research Team or Debate Team, additional options appear:

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Max teammates** | How many specialist agents the lead can spawn | 5 |
| **Model ceiling** | Maximum model any teammate can use | Sonnet |
| **Budget limit** | Optional USD cap for the session | Off |
| **Composition mode** | Dynamic (lead decides roles) or Constrained (lead picks from predefined templates) | Dynamic |

**Dynamic mode** (default): The lead analyzes your request and decides what specialist roles to create. A frontend-heavy feature might get 2 UI specialists and 1 state management specialist. An infrastructure feature might get a DB specialist and a migration specialist.

**Constrained mode**: The lead can only spawn teammates from the predefined templates in `ralphx.yaml`. When this mode is selected, the session creation UI shows the available preset roles (frontend-specialist, backend-specialist, infra-specialist, advocate, critic) so you know exactly what the lead can work with. Use this for security-sensitive workflows.

**Current harness note:** Team mode is currently a Claude-only capability. If the ideation lane is configured to use Codex, RalphX treats the session as solo mode even if older metadata or defaults referenced team behavior.

---

## The Orchestrator Workflow

Whether you use Solo or Team mode, the orchestrator follows a gated workflow with 6 active phases (UNDERSTAND through FINALIZE), preceded by a RECOVER phase (Phase 0) that runs on every session start or resume. Each phase must complete before the next begins.

### Phase 0: RECOVER

On session start (or resume), the orchestrator loads existing session state: prior plan artifact, prior proposals, parent context, team artifacts. If the session is new, this phase is near-instant. If you are resuming an interrupted session, the orchestrator reconstructs its context before continuing.

### Phase 1: UNDERSTAND

The orchestrator parses your intent and determines complexity. In Team mode, this phase also includes **dynamic team composition decision** — the lead determines what specialist roles are needed based on your request and will spawn the corresponding teammates.

### Phase 2: EXPLORE

The orchestrator (or team lead) launches parallel research agents to explore your codebase:

- **Solo mode**: Up to 3 parallel Explore subagents (read-only), each investigating a different aspect of the codebase
- **Team mode**: Dynamic specialist teammates that share their findings with each other via the Claude-native messaging system — enabling cross-domain insights that sequential subagents cannot produce. This is currently available only when the effective harness is Claude.

Research agents have read-only access (no file writes). They use Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, WebFetch, and WebSearch.

You can watch research progress in real time in the session chat panel and (in team mode) in the Team Activity panel.

### Phase 3: PLAN

The orchestrator (or team lead) synthesizes all research findings into a structured implementation plan and publishes it as a **plan artifact**. In Team mode, the lead synthesizes across all teammate findings and may include a Team Research Summary table showing each specialist's key discovery.

The plan artifact is a versioned document — if you reject the plan and ask for changes, a new version is created while prior versions are preserved.

### Phase 4: CONFIRM

**This is the first human checkpoint.** The orchestrator presents the plan to you and waits for explicit approval. It will never create proposals until you approve.

You can:
- **Approve** the plan → moves to PROPOSE
- **Request changes** → the orchestrator revises the plan and returns to CONFIRM
- **Reject** the plan entirely → start over or end the session

### Phase 5: PROPOSE

After you approve the plan, the orchestrator creates **task proposals** — one per implementation task. Each proposal includes:
- Title and detailed description
- Estimated effort
- Dependencies on other proposals (auto-suggested)
- Links to the plan artifact

You can review, edit, add, or delete proposals before they become tasks.

### Phase 6: FINALIZE

The orchestrator performs dependency analysis, determines the critical path, and prepares the session for acceptance. Once finalized, you can accept the session to convert proposals into live tasks.

## Working with the Team Activity Panel

When using Research Team or Debate Team mode, a **Team Activity panel** appears alongside the main chat panel.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Team Activity                              [3/3 ●] │

│  │ Message: [input] Send to: [dropdown ▾]  │        │
│  └──────────────────────────────────────────┘        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Teammate names are **dynamic** — they are assigned by the lead based on the task. The [3/3 ●] badge shows active teammate count.

### Messaging Teammates

You can message the lead or any individual teammate at any point during the session:

1. Click **💬 Message** on a teammate card, or use the bottom input area
2. Type your message and select the recipient from the dropdown
3. Your message appears in the **Team Messages** feed
4. The lead routes your message to the appropriate teammate and relays the response back

Use this to steer research direction, ask about a specific finding, or provide additional context that the agent may not have.

### Token Cost Breakdown

Team sessions show a per-teammate cost breakdown so you can see which roles provided the most value:

```
Session: "Add real-time collaboration"
Mode: Research Team (3 specialists)
Total: ~450K tokens  |  Est. Cost: $3.20

  Lead (Opus):                    ~120K  $1.20
  realtime-transport-researcher:  ~110K  $0.65
  react-state-sync-researcher:    ~130K  $0.80
  event-system-researcher:         ~90K  $0.55
```

---

## The Plan Artifact

The plan artifact is the structured output of the PLAN phase. It is a versioned document stored in the database and linked to all proposals that stem from it.

### Reviewing the Plan

The plan is presented in the session chat panel at the CONFIRM phase. It includes:
- **Architecture overview** — how the feature fits into the existing codebase
- **Implementation approach** — the strategy chosen and why
- **Task breakdown** — how the work is split across proposals
- **Dependencies** — sequencing requirements between tasks
- **Team Research Summary** (team mode only) — a table of each specialist's key finding

In team mode, the plan is tagged `team_ideated: true` so you can correlate plan quality with team usage over time.

### Debate Summary (Debate Team Mode)

When using Debate Team mode, the plan includes a side-by-side debate summary showing each advocate's case:

```
┌─────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────┐
│ WebSockets (Advocate A) │ SSE (Advocate B)         │ Sync Layer (Advocate C) │
├─────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
│ Strengths               │ Strengths                │ Strengths               │
│ - Real-time, bidir.     │ - Simple, HTTP-based     │ - Abstractable          │
├─────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
│ Weaknesses              │ Weaknesses               │ Weaknesses              │
│ - State mgmt complex    │ - One-directional        │ - Over-engineering risk │
├─────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
│ Critic Challenge        │ Critic Challenge         │ Critic Challenge        │
│ "Reconnect handling?"   │ "Server→client only?"    │ "Premature abstraction" │
└─────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘

★ Winner: WebSockets — Lead justification: bidirectional needed for collab editing.
```

As part of the responsive layout, on narrow viewports (typically under 768px wide) this table collapses into vertically stacked collapsible cards for easier use on smaller screens.

---

## Proposals and the CONFIRM Gate

After the plan is approved, the orchestrator creates proposals — one per task. Proposals are shown in the session detail view with their full content, estimated effort, and dependency suggestions.

### Reviewing Proposals

Before accepting the session you can:
- **Edit** any proposal's title, description, or estimated effort
- **Delete** proposals you don't want to implement
- **Add** proposals manually if you want work items the orchestrator missed
- **Reorder** proposals (affects the suggested execution sequence)

Dependency edges between proposals are auto-suggested by the `dependency-suggester` agent. You can add or remove edges in the dependency graph view.

### The CONFIRM Guarantee

> The orchestrator will **never** create proposals before receiving explicit approval at the CONFIRM phase. This is enforced at the agent level — it cannot skip the gate.

If you close the app or navigate away during the CONFIRM phase, the session remains in the CONFIRM state. When you return, the orchestrator resumes from the CONFIRM checkpoint rather than re-running the PLAN phase.

---

## Accepting the Plan and Creating Tasks

When you are satisfied with the proposals, click **Accept** to convert the ideation session into live tasks.

What happens on accept:
1. Each proposal becomes a **Task** in the database
2. Dependency edges from the proposal graph are preserved as task dependencies
3. The session status changes to `accepted`
4. The session is **automatically set as the Active Plan** for the project
5. Tasks appear immediately on the Kanban board and Graph view
6. Ready tasks (no unmet dependencies) are scheduled for execution

---

## Active Plan: Tracking Your Work

After acceptance, the ideation session becomes your **Active Plan** — a focused filter that makes Kanban and Graph show only the tasks from that plan.

### Switching Plans

| Method | How |
|--------|-----|
| **Inline selector** | Click the plan selector in the Kanban toolbar or Graph controls |
| **Quick switcher** | Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) / `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) |

Plans are ranked by your interaction frequency, active task count, and recency — plans you actively work on appear at the top automatically.

### Active Plan Lifecycle

| Event | Effect on Active Plan |
|-------|----------------------|
| Accept ideation session | Auto-set as active plan |
| Reopen accepted session (re-ideate) | Active plan is cleared; Graph/Kanban show empty state |
| Manually switch to another plan | New plan becomes active; old plan loses filter |
| Clear selection | No active plan; both views show empty state |

---

## The Downstream Journey

Once tasks are created from the accepted plan, they flow automatically through RalphX's execution, review, and merge pipeline.

### Execution Pipeline

```
Pending
   │
   v
Executing  ←── Worker agent (ralphx-worker) orchestrates implementation
   │             └── Delegates to coder agents (ralphx-coder) in parallel waves
   v
QA          ←── QA prep agent generates acceptance criteria;
   │              QA executor runs browser tests
   v
Review      ←── Reviewer agent runs automated code review
```

- The **worker agent** decomposes the task into sub-tasks and delegates to up to 3 parallel coder agents
- Tasks with unmet dependencies remain in **Pending** until their dependencies reach **Merged** or **Cancelled**
- You can message a task directly via the task chat panel to provide direction or corrections at any stage

### Review Cycle

When a task reaches **Review**, the `ralphx-reviewer` agent performs a structured code review and produces a list of findings. You see the review in the task detail view.

| Review outcome | What happens |
|----------------|--------------|
| Review passes (no critical issues) | Task moves to **Review Passed** — awaiting your approval |
| Review fails | Task may re-execute to address findings |
| You approve | Task transitions to **Approved** → immediately enters the merge pipeline |
| You reject | Task re-enters execution for another implementation cycle |

### Merge Pipeline

Once a task is **Approved**, it enters the merge pipeline automatically. The pipeline handles everything:

1. **Preparation** — Resolves source and target branches
2. **Branch freshness** — Ensures branches are up-to-date (merges main into plan branch if behind)
3. **Programmatic merge** — Attempts the merge using your project's configured strategy (default: RebaseSquash)
4. **Validation** — Runs your project's test/lint/typecheck commands (default mode: Block — reverts on failure)
5. **Finalization** — Commits the merge, deletes the task branch and worktree

If a conflict arises, a **merger agent** (`ralphx-merger`) is spawned to resolve it. If validation fails in AutoFix mode, a **fixer agent** is spawned to repair the code.

> For complete details on the merge pipeline — states, strategies, recovery, and UI — see the **[Merge Pipeline User Guide](./merge.md)**.

### Plan Branch Flow

For tasks that belong to an ideation plan, RalphX uses a **three-level branch hierarchy**:

```
main
  └── plan/feature-auth          ← Plan branch (one per ideation session)
        ├── ralphx/project/task-abc123   ← Task branch
        ├── ralphx/project/task-def456   ← Task branch
        └── ralphx/project/task-ghi789   ← Task branch
```

Each task merges into the plan branch. When all tasks in the plan are merged, RalphX automatically creates a final **plan-merge task** that appears on your Kanban board and merges the plan branch into `main` once all sibling tasks reach Merged or Cancelled. This approach prevents partial feature merges and allows the full plan to be validated as a unit before touching `main`.

## Troubleshooting

### Session stuck in EXPLORE phase

**What it means:** The research agents are taking longer than expected, or one failed silently.

**What to do:**
1. Check the session chat for error messages from the orchestrator
2. You can message the orchestrator to ask for a status update
3. In team mode, check the Team Activity panel — a stalled teammate status indicator will show

### Orchestrator asked a question but I didn't answer

**What it means:** The `ask_user_question` MCP tool was called, surfacing a question in the session chat. The orchestrator is waiting for your reply before proceeding.

**What to do:** Answer in the session chat panel. The orchestrator resumes automatically when it receives your reply.

### Plan was approved but no proposals appeared

**What it means:** The PROPOSE phase may still be running, or a proposal creation error occurred.

**What to do:**
1. Wait a moment — proposal creation is usually fast but not instant
2. Refresh the session detail view
3. If proposals still don't appear, message the orchestrator: "Please create the proposals now"

### I want to change the plan after accepting

**What it means:** You accepted the session and tasks were created, but you now want a different approach.

**What to do:**
1. Open the Ideation view and find the accepted session
2. Click **Reopen** to return it to active status
3. The active plan is automatically cleared — Kanban and Graph show empty state
4. Chat with the orchestrator to revise the plan; the existing task proposals are preserved for reference
5. Accept again when ready — new tasks are created

> **Note:** Reopening a session does not automatically cancel tasks that were already created. Cancel unwanted tasks manually from the Kanban board.

### Session recovery after app restart

If the app closes during an ideation session, it recovers automatically when you reopen it:
- **UNDERSTAND / EXPLORE phase**: The orchestrator re-reads its session context and resumes research
- **PLAN / CONFIRM phase**: The plan artifact is persisted; the orchestrator resumes from the last completed phase
- **Team mode**: The lead re-reads persisted team state (team composition, team artifacts, prior findings) and re-spawns teammates with context injection. Each teammate receives a structured summary of prior research findings (≤4,000 tokens injected context), not the full message history

### "No plan selected" after accepting a session

**What it means:** The active plan was cleared (e.g., another user action or app restart).

**What to do:**
1. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` to open the quick switcher
2. Type the plan name and select it
3. Kanban and Graph will filter to that plan immediately

### Team mode: teammate appears stuck

**What it means:** A specialist agent stopped sending heartbeats or is running longer than expected.

**What to do:**
1. Check the Team Activity panel — the teammate status badge shows `[Exploring...]`, `[Idle]`, or `[Stalled]`
2. Send a direct message to the stalled teammate (click **💬 Message**) to ask for a status update
3. The lead monitors teammate health and will reassign work if a teammate fails to respond

## Configuration Reference

### Session-Level Settings (per session)

| Setting | Description | Options | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `teamMode` | Ideation mode for this session | `solo`, `research`, `debate` | `solo` |
| `maxTeammates` | Maximum teammates the lead can spawn | 2–8 | 5 |
| `modelCeiling` | Maximum model any teammate can use | `haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus` | `sonnet` |
| `budgetLimit` | Optional USD cap for the team session | Any amount or disabled | Disabled |
| `compositionMode` | How the lead selects teammate roles | `dynamic`, `constrained` | `dynamic` |

### Team Constraints (ralphx.yaml)

The `team_constraints.ideation` section in `ralphx.yaml` defines the ceiling for all ideation teammates — these are enforced by the backend regardless of what the lead requests:

```yaml
team_constraints:
  ideation:
    max_teammates: 5
    model_ceiling: sonnet
    tool_ceiling:
      allowed: [Read, Grep, Glob, WebFetch, WebSearch, Task]
      denied: [Write, Edit]       # All ideation teammates are read-only
    mcp_tool_ceiling:
      - get_session_plan
      - list_session_proposals
      - create_team_artifact
      - get_team_artifacts
    bash_allowed: true
```

### Validation Commands (Project Settings)

After tasks merge, the merge pipeline validates your code. These are configured at the project level, not the ideation session level. See the [Merge Pipeline User Guide — Configuration Reference](./merge.md#configuration-reference) for details.

### Active Plan Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) / `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Win/Linux) | Open plan quick switcher |
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate plans in selector |
| `Enter` | Select highlighted plan |
| `Escape` | Close selector |
