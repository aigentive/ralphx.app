# Project Settings & Configuration User Guide

RalphX is highly configurable — from how tasks execute concurrently to which AI models run your agents. This guide covers every setting, where to find it, and what it does.

## Quick Reference

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Where are project settings? | Sidebar → Settings (gear icon) for the active project |
| How do I create a new project? | File menu → New Project (or the "+" button in the project switcher) |
| What merge strategy should I use? | **Block** validation + **RebaseSquash** strategy is the safest default |
| How do I change my base branch? | Settings → Git → Base Branch (or click "Detect" to auto-detect) |
| Why are my tasks not running? | Check **Max Concurrent Tasks** — may be at the limit, or global cap reached |
| How do I run tests after merges? | Settings → Git → Merge Validation, then configure commands in **Project Analysis** |
| What is the worktree directory? | Where task code lives during execution — never touches your main checkout |
| How do I override agent timeouts? | Edit `ralphx.yaml` in the project root — all timing knobs are there |

## Creating a Project

The **Project Creation Wizard** opens the first time you launch RalphX, and any time you add a new project from the project switcher.

### Wizard Steps

1. **Pick a folder** — Click "Browse" to select your git repository's root directory. RalphX reads the folder name and uses it as the default project name.
2. **Name** — Auto-populated from the folder name. Edit to customize.
3. **Base branch** — RalphX auto-detects your repository's default branch (usually `main` or `master`). Override via the dropdown.
4. **Advanced settings (optional)** — Expand to set a custom worktree directory. Defaults to `~/ralphx-worktrees/{project-name}`.

> **Git requirement:** The selected directory must be an initialized git repository. RalphX will show a warning if it can't detect git.

### What Gets Created

| Resource | Created automatically |
|----------|-----------------------|
| Project record | Stored in `ralphx.db` |
| Project slug | Derived from project name (used in branch and worktree names) |
| Default settings | Applied from built-in defaults (overridable in Settings) |
| First analysis | Scheduled — an AI agent scans your project's build system |

---

## Git Configuration

**Location:** Settings → Git

Git settings control how RalphX interacts with your repository during task execution and merging.

### Base Branch

The branch all tasks merge into. Default: `main`.

- Click **Detect** to auto-detect your repository's default branch from `origin`
- Tasks branch from this (or from their plan branch if part of a plan)
- Changing this affects future tasks only — in-progress tasks keep their existing branch targets

### Worktree Location

The parent directory where task worktrees are created. Default: `~/ralphx-worktrees`.

```
~/ralphx-worktrees/
  my-project/
    task-abc123/   ← one worktree per task
    task-def456/
```

> **Your main checkout is never touched.** All agent file operations happen inside the task's worktree.

You can change this to a different disk or SSD if you have disk space concerns, or to a RAM disk for faster I/O. The path must be writable.

### Feature Branches

When enabled, each **plan** gets its own feature branch (e.g., `plan/auth-refactor`). Tasks in the plan merge into the plan branch first, then the plan branch merges to main when all tasks complete.

When disabled, all tasks merge directly to the base branch.

| Mode | Branch flow |
|------|------------|
| Feature branches off | Task branch → base branch (main) |
| Feature branches on | Task branch → plan branch → base branch (main) |

This setting applies to new plans only — existing plans keep their current configuration.

### Merge Validation

What happens when post-merge validation (tests, lint, typecheck) fails.

| Mode | What happens on failure | When to use |
|------|------------------------|-------------|
| **Block on Failure** (default) | Merge is reverted; task moves to MergeIncomplete | Production projects — ensures only passing code lands |
| **Auto-fix** | An AI agent attempts to fix the failures in the merged code | Projects where most failures are auto-fixable |
| **Warn on Failure** | Merge completes; failures stored as warnings | Non-critical validation (advisory only) |
| **Disabled** | Validation is skipped entirely | Small projects or when testing manually |

Validation commands are configured in [Project Analysis](#project-analysis).

---

## Merge Settings

The merge strategy controls _how_ git integrates a task's code into the target branch. Set per-project in **Settings → Git → Merge Validation** (strategy is part of git settings). The four strategies are:

| Strategy | How it works | Git history | Best for |
|----------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **RebaseSquash** (default) | Rebases onto target, then squashes into one commit | Cleanest linear history | Most projects |
| **Squash** | Combines all commits into one on the target | Linear, one commit per task | Clean history without rebase |
| **Rebase** | Replays commits on top of target; fast-forwards | Linear with individual commits | Preserving per-commit history |
| **Merge** | Creates a merge commit combining source and target | Non-linear (merge commits visible) | Teams requiring full history |

> **Strategy applies project-wide.** All tasks use the same strategy. You can change it at any time — the new strategy applies to future merges only.

For a detailed explanation of the merge pipeline, see the [Merge Pipeline User Guide](merge.md).

---

## Execution Settings

**Location:** Settings → Execution (per-project) and Settings → Global Execution (cross-project)

Execution settings control how many tasks run simultaneously and what happens when things go wrong.

### Per-Project Execution Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Max Concurrent Tasks** | 10 | Maximum tasks running simultaneously in this project. The UI slider range is 1–10; this is the slider range only, not a system hard limit. Bounded in practice by the global cap. |
| **Auto Commit** | On | Automatically commit uncommitted changes in the worktree after a task completes execution |
| **Pause on Failure** | On | Stop the task queue when any task in this project fails |
| **Review Before Destructive** | On | Insert a review point before tasks that delete files or modify configuration |

### Global Execution Settings

| Setting | Default | Range | Description |
|---------|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Global Max Concurrent** | 20 | 1–50 | Hard cap on total concurrent agents across ALL projects. Tasks wait in Ready when this limit is reached. |

> **How the limits interact:** A task can only start if _both_ its project's `max_concurrent_tasks` limit AND the `global_max_concurrent` limit have available capacity.

### What Consumes a Concurrency Slot

Active agent states each consume one slot:

- Executing, ReExecuting, QaRefining, QaTesting, Reviewing, Merging

States that do **not** consume a slot: Ready, QaPassed, PendingReview, ReviewPassed, Paused, Stopped, Failed.

For a complete explanation of scheduling behavior, see the [Execution Pipeline User Guide](execution.md).

---

## Review Settings

**Location:** Settings → Review

Review settings control the AI code review process that runs after each task completes execution.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Enable AI Review** | On | Run an AI reviewer after execution. If disabled, tasks go directly to ReviewPassed (human approval required). |
| **Auto Create Fix Tasks** | On | When the AI reviewer finds issues, automatically create fix tasks and queue them for execution |
| **Require Fix Approval** | Off | Require human approval before executing AI-proposed fix tasks |
| **Require Human Review** | Off | Require your approval even after the AI reviewer approves. Enables a human sign-off step for all tasks. |
| **Max Fix Attempts** | 3 | Maximum times AI can propose fix tasks before the original task is moved to backlog |

### Review Flow

```
Execution complete
    │
    ▼
Reviewing (AI reviewer analyzes code, diff, tests)
    │
    ├── approved    → ReviewPassed → your approval → Approved → Merge
    ├── needs_changes → RevisionNeeded → ReExecuting → (loop)
    └── escalate    → Escalated → your decision required
```

When **Require Human Review** is on, even after AI approval the task stays in ReviewPassed until you click Approve.

---

## Supervisor Settings

**Location:** Settings → Supervisor

The supervisor is a lightweight Haiku agent that monitors worker agents for loops, stuck behavior, and runaway token usage.

| Setting | Default | Range | Description |
|---------|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Enable Supervisor** | On | On/Off | Enable watchdog monitoring alongside worker agents |
| **Loop Threshold** | 3 | 2–10 | Number of identical tool calls before loop detection triggers |
| **Stuck Timeout** | 150 seconds (~2.5 minutes) | 60–1800 | Seconds without git diff progress before stuck detection triggers (5 checks at 30-second intervals) |

### What the Supervisor Does

| Pattern detected | Action |
|-----------------|--------|
| Same tool called N+ times with similar args | Injects guidance into the agent |
| No git diff changes for `stuck_timeout` seconds | Injects guidance or escalates |
| Same error repeating 3+ times | Injects guidance; 4+ times → pauses task |
| Token usage over threshold with no progress | Pauses task and notifies |
| Critical loop detected | Kills agent, analyzes, escalates |

The supervisor runs _alongside_ the worker — it does not consume an extra concurrency slot.

---

## Model Configuration

**Location:** Settings → Model

| Setting | Default | Options | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Default Model** | `sonnet` | haiku, sonnet, opus | Base Claude model used for task execution agents |
| **Allow Opus Upgrade** | On | On/Off | Automatically upgrade to Opus for complex tasks identified by the system |

### Agent Model Mapping

Different agent roles use different models, configured in `ralphx.yaml`:

| Agent | Default model | Role |
|-------|--------------|------|
| orchestrator-ideation | Sonnet | Ideation planning |
| ralphx-worker | Sonnet | Task execution |
| ralphx-coder | Sonnet | File-level coding |
| ralphx-reviewer | Sonnet | Code review |
| ralphx-merger | Opus | Conflict resolution |
| ralphx-supervisor | Haiku | Loop detection watchdog |
| project-analyzer | Haiku | Build system detection |

Model overrides per agent are set in the `agents:` section of `ralphx.yaml`.

---

## Ideation Settings

**Location:** Settings → Ideation

Ideation settings control how RalphX handles implementation planning in the Ideation Studio.

### Plan Workflow Mode

Controls when implementation plans are created relative to task proposals.

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|---------|
| **Required** | A plan must be created before any proposals can be made |
| **Optional** (default) | Plans are suggested for complex features but not required |
| **Parallel** | Plan and proposals are created simultaneously |

### Other Ideation Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Require explicit approval** | Off | In Required mode: user must click "Approve Plan" before proposals are created |
| **Suggest plans for complex features** | On | In Optional mode: prompts you to create a plan when the feature seems complex |
| **Auto-link proposals to session plan** | On | Automatically sets the plan reference when creating proposals in a session |

---

## Project Analysis

**Location:** Settings → Project Analysis

The Project Analysis section manages the commands RalphX uses to set up and validate task worktrees. This is how RalphX knows to run `npm install` before executing and `cargo clippy` after merging.

### Auto-Detection

When you create a project (or click **Re-analyze**), a `project-analyzer` agent scans your repository and detects:
- Build systems (npm, cargo, make, etc.)
- Install commands (e.g., `npm install`, `pip install`)
- Validation commands (e.g., `npm run typecheck`, `cargo test --lib`)

The **Last Analyzed** timestamp shows when detection last ran.

### Customizing Commands

Each detected entry shows as an editable row. You can:
- **Edit commands** inline — click any field to modify it
- **Reset a field** — revert a single customized field to the detected value
- **Add an entry** — manually add a build system entry
- **Remove an entry** — delete an auto-detected or custom entry

Changes are staged locally. Click **Save** in the footer bar to persist them.

### Template Variables

Use these in your command strings:

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `{project_root}` | Project working directory |
| `{worktree_path}` | Task worktree directory (available during execution/validation) |
| `{task_branch}` | Task branch name (available during execution) |

### Custom Analysis Format

The analysis is stored as JSON with two sections:

```json
{
  "worktree_setup": [
    { "command": "npm install", "path": ".", "label": "Install dependencies" }
  ],
  "validate": [
    { "command": "npm run typecheck", "path": ".", "label": "Type Check" },
    { "command": "cargo clippy --all-targets", "path": "src-tauri", "label": "Clippy" },
    { "command": "cargo test --lib", "path": "src-tauri", "label": "Tests" }
  ]
}
```

- **`worktree_setup`** — Runs before the worker agent starts (install dependencies, create symlinks). Failures are non-fatal in Warn mode.
- **`validate`** — Runs after a merge to verify code quality. Failures trigger the selected validation mode (Block/AutoFix/Warn/Off).

---

## Advanced: ralphx.yaml

`ralphx.yaml` (in your project root) is the runtime configuration file for all timing, retry limits, and agent behavior. **The UI does not expose these settings** — edit the file directly in a text editor.

All settings support environment variable overrides: `RALPHX_<SECTION>_<FIELD>` (e.g., `RALPHX_RECONCILIATION_MERGER_TIMEOUT_SECS=300`).
